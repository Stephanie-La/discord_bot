# discord_bot
My first bot I will attempt building is called Florida Man Bot. Florida Man Bot is a Discord API built with Javscript and Node.JS, with command prompt and Visual Studio Code for debugging and control function purposes. 

I plan to give this bot a command, which is a specific date of any of the 365 days of the year, and it will return to me a link to an article about a Floridian who has commited  crazy or outrageous crimes in the state of Florida. This is a funny idea used to explore funny articles, not to ridicule anyone mentioned in these potential links.
